# Welcome to My Blog!

Hello and welcome to my new Markdown-powered blog! This is my first post, and I'm excited to share my thoughts with you.

## What is This Blog About?

This blog is built with **Node.js** and **Express**, and it serves Markdown files directly from the file system. It's simple, fast, and easy to maintain.

### Features

- **Markdown Support**: Write posts in Markdown format
- **Easy to Use**: Simple interface for creating and viewing posts
- **File-Based**: No database required - posts are stored as `.md` files
- **Clean Design**: Minimalist and readable

## Getting Started

To create a new post, simply click the "New Post" button on the home page. You can use all standard Markdown syntax including:

- **Bold** and *italic* text
- Lists (like this one!)
- Code blocks
- Links and more

### Example Code

Here's a simple JavaScript example:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
```

## Conclusion

I hope you enjoy reading my posts. Feel free to explore and come back for more content!
